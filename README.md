# Getting Started with Ludmila App
You need to open 2 tabs each acting as a different user. The whole idea behind this project is having local storage serve as the socketio for providing live feed of the message in the other tab.

Click [HereðŸš€ðŸš€](https://ludmila-app.vercel.app/) to get redirected to the app page where you'll be asked to enter a name first.

## Installation
Clone down this repository. You will need node and npm installed globally on your machine.
